# Assignment 3
In this assignment I built on-top of the cloud-based and edge-based components developed in the previous assignments. I replaced the MQTT protocol and the short-range wireless medium with *LoRaWAN* and [*TheThingsNetwork*](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/), so I developed a new [*RIOT-OS*](https://riot-os.org/) application that runs on the B-L072Z-LRWAN1 LoRa kit which generates values for 5 different sensors. I used *TheThingsNetwork* to interconnect the sensor devices with the cloud infrastructure via the MQTT protocol. I also used [*IOT-LAB*](https://www.iot-lab.info/) to execute the *RIOT-OS* application on real devices.

# LoRaWAN Station
Using *RIOT-OS* I developed an application that represents a virtual environmental station that generates periodically a set of random values for 5 different sensors:

- temperature (-50 ... 50 Celsius)
- humidity (0 ... 100%)
- wind direction (0 ... 360 degrees)
- wind intensity (0 ... 100 m/s)
- rain height (0 ... 50 mm / h)

The virtual environmental station uses a unique ID (identity) to publish these random values on *TheThingsNetwork* via *LoRaWAN*, so you can start several instances running on the boards.

# TTN/Cloud transparent bridge
Using *Python* language programming I developed an MQTT transparent bridge. The goal of the bridge is to connect to *TheThingsNetwork* and forward all messages received to a topic on the MQTT broker that is controlled by the cloud-based backend (i.e., publish them), configured during the first assignment via *AWS IoT*.

The values generated by the *RIOT-OS* application developed in the previous step and interconnected via *LoRaWAN* are visible through the [websites](https://666thenumberofthebeast.github.io/InternetOfThings19-20/) developed in the first assignment.
